# What the bracket scan computes

A model of the left-to-right pass over a serialized `Data` value: a bracket
depth, a count of the top-level children already passed, and the bits collected
while inside the child that was asked for. This file is about the model alone —
that it really does extract the requested child — and says nothing about
computability; `Complexitylib.Classes.PCP.Internal.DataScan` runs the same pass
as a polynomial-time fold.

Two facts drive everything. The depth and the count evolve without looking at
the collected bits, and the collected bits only ever grow at the end
(`runSpec_append_acc`); and a serialized value read at any depth returns to that
depth, having contributed exactly its own serialization when it was the child
being sought (`runSpec_toBits`).

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.DataScan.runSpec` — the model of the pass

## Main results

- `Complexity.DataScan.runSpec_toBits` — reading one serialized value
- `Complexity.DataScan.runSpec_flatten` — reading a whole run of children
- `Complexity.DataScan.runSpec_inner` — the pass over a serialized list returns
  the requested child
