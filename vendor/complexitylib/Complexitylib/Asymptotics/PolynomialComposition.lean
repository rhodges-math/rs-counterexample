# Polynomial composition bounds

This module packages natural-polynomial composition as power-form big-O
bounds. The second theorem records the coarse time expression used when two
deterministic function computations are connected sequentially.

## Main results

- `BigO.polynomial_eval_comp` — nested polynomial evaluation is polynomially bounded
- `BigO.polynomial_composition_time` — the coarse sequential runtime is polynomially bounded
