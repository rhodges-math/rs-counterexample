# Polynomial-time normal forms — proof internals

The definitions of `P` and `FP` permit arbitrary time functions with Big-O
power bounds. This module replaces either witness by the evaluation of one
polynomial over the naturals, giving everywhere-valid monotone time bounds.

The public theorem is in `Complexitylib.Classes.P.NormalForm`.
