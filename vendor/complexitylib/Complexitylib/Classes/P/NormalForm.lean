# Polynomial-time normal forms

`P` and `FP` membership can be witnessed by deterministic machines whose
running-time bounds are evaluations of polynomials with natural coefficients.
Unlike the arbitrary asymptotic witnesses in the class definitions, these
normalized bounds are valid on every input length and are monotone.

## Main result

- `mem_P_iff_decidesInTime_polynomial` — polynomial-evaluation normal form for `P`
- `mem_FP_iff_computesInTime_polynomial` — polynomial-evaluation normal form for `FP`
