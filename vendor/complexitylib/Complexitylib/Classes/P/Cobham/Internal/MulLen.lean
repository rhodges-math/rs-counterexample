# Multiplying the block lengths of a pair — proof internals

This module builds the one quadratic-output transducer needed by Cobham's
soundness direction: from `pair A B` it emits `|A| · |B|` copies of `false`,
which is exactly the length behaviour of `Complexity.smash`. The soundness proof
then applies `unaryLength_mem_FP` to turn this internal zero-filled ruler into
Cobham's all-one smash word.

The machine `mulLenTM` is self-contained (one work tape, eight control states):

1. *scan* — parse the leading self-delimiting block two symbols at a time,
   writing one unary mark on the work tape per payload bit, so the work tape
   ends up holding `|A|` in unary;
2. *outer loop* — for every remaining input symbol (i.e. `|B|` times) run the
   *emit* pass, which walks the `|A|` marks writing one `false` per mark, and
   the *rewind* pass, which returns the work head to cell one.

Malformed input halts with empty output, matching `unpair? = none`.

## Main results

- `Complexity.Cobham.mulUnpair_mem_FP` — the block-length product is `FP`

/-- The scan pass: from `scanA`, with `k` payload bits already counted as marks on
the work tape and `w` still unread, the machine runs the rest of the computation
and halts with `mulAux k w` on the output tape. The parameter `N` is a fuel bound
on `k + |w|`, which strictly decreases across the recursive step. -/
