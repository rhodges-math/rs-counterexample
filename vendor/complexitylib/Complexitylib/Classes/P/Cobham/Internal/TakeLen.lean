# Truncating to the length of a leading block — proof internals

`takeLen (pair c y) = y.take |c|`: the leading self-delimiting block acts as a
*ruler* and the verbatim suffix is truncated to its length. Carrying a width
bound as a string rather than as a number is what keeps an iterated `FP` step
function polynomial-time — each iteration truncates its state to the ruler, so no
intermediate value can grow beyond it.

The transducer `takeLenTM` has one work tape: *scan* parses the leading block two
symbols at a time, writing one unary mark per payload bit; *rewind* returns the
work head to cell one; *copy* emits one input symbol per remaining mark.
Malformed input halts with empty output, matching `unpair? = none`.

## Main results

- `Complexity.takeLen_pair` — the defining equation on genuine pairs
- `Complexity.takeLen_mem_FP` — the truncation is in `FP`
