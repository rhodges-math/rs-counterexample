# Testing a leading bit — proof internals

Every other `FP` primitive the Cobham proof uses — `Complexity.takeLen`,
`List.reverse`, `Complexity.pair`, `Cobham.mulUnpair` — fixes its output's
*length* from its inputs' lengths alone, so none of them can react to a bit's
value. `Complexity.headFlag` closes that gap by turning a bit test into a length:
the answer is carried by whether the result is empty. Its two-state transducer
moves off the left-end marker, then emits one bit exactly when the first input
bit matches.

## Main results

- `Complexity.headFlag_mem_FP` — the leading-bit test is in `FP`
