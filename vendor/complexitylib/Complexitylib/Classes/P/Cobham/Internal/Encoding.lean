# Encoding machine configurations as bitstrings — proof internals

The completeness direction of Cobham's theorem simulates a polynomial-time
machine inside the function algebra, so a configuration has to become a single
bitstring. This module fixes that encoding and proves the arithmetic facts about
it; the algebra-side operations that act on it live in
`Complexitylib.Classes.P.Cobham.Internal.StepAlgebra`.

## The two design choices

**Two bits per symbol, with blank `= 00`.** Fixed-width blocks are padded with
zeros (`Complexity.padTo`), so making blank the all-zero code means padding a
tape block with zeros *is* extending it with blanks — the padding needs no
special treatment anywhere.

**Tapes split at the head.** A tape is stored as its cells to the left of the
head, nearest first, and its cells from the head rightwards. Then a head move is
transferring one symbol between the two sides, i.e. a `take`/`drop`/`append` of
two bits, rather than arithmetic on a position index. Reading is the first two
bits of the right part.

Cell `0` is the only `▷` (the writable alphabet `Γw` excludes it), so "the head
is at cell 0" is exactly "the read symbol is `▷`" — and in that case
`TM.δ_right_of_start` forces a move right. The left part is therefore never
consulted when it is empty, which is why it needs no emptiness test.

## Main definitions

- `Complexity.Cobham.symCode` — two-bit code for `Γ`
- `Complexity.Cobham.cellsCode` — a window of cells as a bitstring
- `Complexity.Cobham.leftCode`, `Complexity.Cobham.rightCode` — a tape split at
  its head

## Main results

The six lemmas that make the split representation simulate `Tape.writeAndMove`,
each expressing one head move as two bits crossing the split:

- `leftCode_write_stay`, `rightCode_write_stay`
- `leftCode_write_right`, `rightCode_write_right`
- `leftCode_write_left`, `rightCode_write_left`

Every right-hand side is built from `take 2`, `drop 2`, `++` and the constant
`symCode s` — all of which the algebra has (`Cobham.takeFn`, `Cobham.dropFn`,
`Cobham.appendFn`, `Cobham.const`).

/-! ## The symbol code -/

/-! ## The control state

The state is stored one-hot: `|Q|` bits with a single `1`. Fixed width and
injective, and — the point — every state's code is a *constant* for a fixed
machine, so the transition table is finitely many `Cobham.matchPrefixFn` tests
against constants (`Cobham.tableFn`). Binary would need arithmetic; one-hot needs
none. -/

/-- One-hot code for a control state: one bit per element of `Q`, set exactly at
the state itself.

Noncomputable only because `Finset.toList` picks an enumeration order; the code
appears solely in specifications, never in a machine that must run. -/

The width is `W + 1 - head`, complementary to `leftCode`'s `head`, so the two

/-! ### Writing and moving

`Tape.write` never touches cell `0` (the model makes writing there a no-op), and
`Γw` cannot produce `▷`, so cell `0` is permanently the unique `▷`. Hence "the
head is at `0`" is exactly "the read symbol is `▷`", and `TM.δ_right_of_start`
then forces a right move — which is why the left half is never consulted while
empty. -/

`correctWrite`. -/

Every field occupies a block of the same width, so field `i` is recovered by

width. -/

A head moves at most one cell per step and starts at cell `0`, so after `t` steps

The encoded step on a tape's two half-blocks. Every right-hand side is

with `Cobham.takeFn`, `Cobham.dropFn`, `Cobham.appendFn`, `Cobham.const` and
`Cobham.padFn` — and within one branch of `Cobham.tableFn` the symbol `s` and the
direction `d` are *constants*. -/

/-- **The encoded step simulates `Tape.writeAndMove`** on both half-blocks.

The hypotheses are exactly what the corrected encoded action supplies. `hs`: at
cell `0` the write is a no-op, so `correctWrite` replaces the raw `Γw` symbol by
the existing `▷`. `hne`: `TM.δ_right_of_start` ensures that a head at cell `0`

`List.zipWith` against the transition's per-tape actions, with no positional
index arithmetic. -/
