# Cobham's characterization of FP — surface layer

Cobham's theorem (1965): the machine-independent function algebra
`Complexity.Cobham` of `Complexitylib.Classes.P.Cobham.Defs` carves out exactly
the polynomial-time computable string functions.

## Main results

- `Cobham.cobham_iff_FPn` — the characterization at every fixed arity
- `CobhamFP_subset_FP` — every function of the algebra is polynomial-time
- `FP_subset_CobhamFP` — every polynomial-time function is in the algebra
- `CobhamFP_eq_FP` — **Cobham's theorem**, the two directions together

## How the two directions are proved

Both halves live in `Complexitylib.Classes.P.Cobham.Internal`.

*Soundness* is the induction `Cobham f → FPn f` over the six constructors, where
`Cobham.FPn` lifts `FP` to argument vectors through the tuple encoding
`Cobham.encodeVec`. Four constructors are bespoke transducers
(`Cobham.cons_mem_FP`, `fstBlock_mem_FP`, `sndBlock_mem_FP`, `reorder_mem_FP`,
`mulLenFn_mem_FP`); the fifth, `boundedRec`, is a loop: recursion on notation is
a fold (`Cobham.recFold_eq_recNotation`), Cobham's side condition makes its width
clamp vacuous (`Cobham.recFoldClamp_eq_recFold`), and `Cobham.iterate_mem_FP`
runs the clamped step once per bit under a polynomial ruler.

*Completeness* simulates a polynomial-time machine inside the algebra. A whole
configuration is one block-aligned bitstring with each tape split at its head, so
a head move is a two-bit shift (`Cobham.cfgCode`); the transition function is the
finite table `Cobham.stepFn`; the run is `Cobham.iterFn` under a clock built from
`smash` (`Cobham.exists_pow_clock`); and the output is read off the output tape
after a rewind (`Cobham.rewindFn`). The assembly is `Cobham.simFn_eq`.
