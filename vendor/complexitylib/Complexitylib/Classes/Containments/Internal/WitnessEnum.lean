# Enumerating the witnesses of a bounded existential

⚠️ Unreviewed by Bolton

`polyExistsLang` quantifies over witnesses `w` with `|w| ≤ p |x|`. A machine cannot quantify; it
counts. This file replaces the quantifier over strings by a quantifier over a *length* and a
*value* — the two numbers a loop actually iterates — by exhibiting the round trip between a
bitstring and its length-plus-binary-value.

Nothing here is about machines: it is the arithmetic that makes an enumeration faithful.

## Main definitions

- `binVal` — the big-endian value of a bitstring
- `bitsOfLen` — the bitstring of a given length and value

## Main results

- `bitsOfLen_binVal`, `binVal_bitsOfLen` — the round trip, both ways: a bijection between
  bitstrings and length-plus-value pairs
- `exists_bounded_iff`, `exists_bounded_iff_le` — the bounded existential over strings is one
  over two numbers, in either bit order
- `binValLE_eq_fromBitsLE`, `bitsOfLenLE_eq_toBitsLE` — the little-endian forms are
  `Nat.fromBitsLE` and `Nat.toBitsLE`
- `choicesOfNat`, `natOfChoices` — choice sequences as counter values, for the path-counting
  machine
- `bitsOfLenLE_getElem`, `choicesOfNat_apply` — each bit of the enumeration is a bit of the
  counter, in the form a tape encoding produces
- `binValLE_bits`, `bits_injective` — the canonical counter representation determines its value
- `getD_eq_bit` — reading a bitstring past its end agrees with reading the number's bits
- `dropTop`, `topPlus`, `exists_bounded_iff_count` — the same existential as a single count, over
  the counter values below `2 ^ (m + 1)`
- `bumpLE`, `dropTop_succ` — the witness advances in step with the counter, so a machine can
  carry it on a tape instead of computing it

/-! ## The little-endian enumeration

Every binary subroutine in the library — `TM.binarySuccTM` and the rest — uses canonical
little-endian bit lists. Since the *order* in which witnesses are enumerated is immaterial, only
that the enumeration is a bijection, the machine should use the convention its counter already
speaks. These are the little-endian counterparts of the definitions above. -/

A nested loop over a length and then a value is two loops; a machine that enumerates witnesses
would rather run one. Appending a marker bit turns the enumeration into a plain count: the
numbers in `[1, 2 ^ (m + 1))` are in bijection with the bitstrings of length at most `m`, a
number denoting its canonical bits with the leading one removed. -/

/-! ## Enumerating the witness alongside the counter

The machine will not compute `dropTop` from the counter; it will carry the witness on a tape of
its own and advance it in step with the counter. `bumpLE` is that advance — the counter's
increment seen through `dropTop`. It is the ordinary little-endian increment except at the end of
the string, where the carry *extends* the witness by a zero instead of writing a one: the bit it
would have written is the counter's leading one, which `dropTop` discards. -/
