# Frame rules for composite machines

Two things a machine built out of sub-machines needs to know: that a
sub-machine's Hoare triple still holds once its tapes are embedded in a larger
tape space (`TM.placeWorkTM_hoareTime_frame`), and that a run of bounded length
cannot have touched cells far from where its heads started
(`TM.reachesIn_work_cells_far`). The second is what lets a *bounded* wipe reset
an opaque machine's scratch completely.

## Main results

- `TM.placeWorkTM_hoareTime_frame` — a Hoare triple survives tape embedding
- `TM.reachesIn_work_cells_far` — a `t`-step run leaves cells beyond `head + t` alone
- `TM.reachesIn_startInvariant` — runs preserve `Tape.StartInvariant`
- `TM.seqTM_det` — sequential composition is deterministic on its components
- `TM.IdlesInput` — machines that never move their input head

/-! ## Embedding a Hoare triple in a larger tape space

A composite machine runs sub-machines that each own a fixed number of work
tapes, while carrying persistent state (running values, fuel registers) on tapes
those sub-machines never touch. `TM.placeWorkTM` already gives the exact
frame-preserving simulation
(`placeWorkTM_reachesIn_placeWorkCfg_of_startInvariant`); the lemma below turns
that into a Hoare-triple-level tool, so each embedding is a single lemma
application instead of a fresh `reachesIn` argument. -/

/-- **Placing a Hoare triple.** If `tm : TM n` satisfies a Hoare triple, then
`placeWorkTM pre post tm` satisfies the triple obtained by reindexing `tm`'s
work-tape predicate through the middle block, with an arbitrary `Parked`-style
frame (`extras`) held exactly fixed outside it. -/

/-! ## What a bounded run can have disturbed

Resetting an opaque machine's scratch tapes between calls needs
to know *how far out* the machine could possibly have written. Since each head
moves by at most one cell per step and a machine only ever writes under its
heads, a `t`-step run leaves every cell beyond `head + t` exactly as it found
it. That is what makes the bounded wipe of `TM.resetTapesTM` complete rather
than merely partial. -/

/-- One step leaves every work-tape cell other than that tape's own head
unchanged: a machine writes only under its heads. -/
