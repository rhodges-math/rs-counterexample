# Pair emission from the input and a work tape

This file defines a small deterministic transducer that emits `pair first second`.
The first component is scanned on a designated work tape and doubled on the
output; the second component is then copied verbatim from the real input tape.
Both sources are consumed only through their first blank delimiter.

## Main definitions

- `TM.PairInputWorkPhase` — the five control phases of the emitter
- `TM.pairInputWorkTM` — emit a pair from one work tape and the input
- `TM.pairInputWorkTime` — the exact running time on canonical sources
