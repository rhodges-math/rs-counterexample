# Resetting a list of tapes to blank, content-agnostically

The full reset an opaque machine's scratch needs between calls: park everything
(`TM.parkAll_hoareTime`), rewind every targeted tape to cell `1`
(`TM.rewindList_hoareTime`), then wipe `H` cells forward from there
(`TM.wipeLoop_hoareTime`). A fuel register disjoint from the targets drives the
wipe and is left exactly as it started.

## Main results

- `TM.resetTapesTM` — the composite reset machine
- `TM.resetTapesTM_hoareTime` / `TM.resetTapesTM_hoareTime_of_bounds` — its contract

/-- **Resetting a list of tapes.** Regardless of their current content or head
position (bounded by `H`), every tape in `targets` ends up blanked from cell
`1` through cell `H`, with its tail beyond cell `H` untouched; the fuel
register `r` (disjoint from `targets`) and every other tape are exactly as
they were. -/
