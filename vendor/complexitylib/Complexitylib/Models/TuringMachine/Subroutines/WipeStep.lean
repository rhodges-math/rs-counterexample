# An unconditional, content-agnostic wipe step

Reusing an opaque machine's scratch tapes across calls needs them genuinely
blank in between, but an arbitrary machine may leave *gaps* — an isolated blank
cell with more content beyond it — and a content-driven scanner
(`TM.blankWorkTM` stops at the first blank) under-wipes there. `TM.wipeStepTM`
writes `Γ.blank` to every targeted tape and advances, unconditionally, never
reading what it overwrites; iterated a known number of times it blanks an exact
number of cells whatever was there.

## Main results

- `TM.wipeStepTM` — blank one cell of every targeted tape and advance
- `TM.wipeStepTM_hoareTime` — its one-step contract
