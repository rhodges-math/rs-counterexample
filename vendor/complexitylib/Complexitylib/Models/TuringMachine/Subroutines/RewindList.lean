# Rewinding a list of tapes, one at a time

Rewinding cannot be done in one uniform pass the way wiping can:
`TM.rewindWorkTM` bounces at `▷` rather than saturating there, so moving
everyone left the same number of times oscillates. Doing it one tape at a time
via `TM.bigSeqTM` works once every tape has been parked once
(`TM.parkAll_hoareTime`).

## Main results

- `TM.rewindList_hoareTime` — rewind every targeted tape to cell `1`

/-- **Rewinding a list of tapes, one at a time.** Given a uniform head bound
`B` and that *every* tape (not just the targets) is already `Parked` — the
state after `parkAll_hoareTime` — sequentially rewinding each named tape
lands it at cell `1` with its cells unchanged, leaving every other tape
(targeted-but-not-yet-reached, or never targeted) exactly as it was. -/
