# Moving left unconditionally

Before scratch tapes can be wiped (`TM.wipeStepTM` scans rightward), every head
needs to be at a *known* position. The `▷` marker at cell `0` is immutable, so
moving left far enough always reaches it whatever the content:
`TM.moveLeftStepTM`, run enough times, is a content-agnostic bulk rewind for a
whole list of tapes, exactly as `TM.wipeStepTM` is a content-agnostic bulk wipe.

## Main results

- `TM.moveLeftStepTM` — move every targeted tape one cell left
- `TM.moveLeftStepTM_hoareTime` — its one-step contract
