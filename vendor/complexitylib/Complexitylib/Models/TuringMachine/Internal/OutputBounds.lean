# Output-length bounds — proof internals

This module proves that a deterministic machine cannot produce more output
bits than the number of transitions it has taken. The key support lemma says
that an output cell beyond the initial head position plus the elapsed time is
unchanged.

Public statements are in `Complexitylib.Models.TuringMachine.OutputBounds`.
